        <h2>Weather Website created using Express.</h2>
        
<xmp>
       This is the Weather website where user can enter any city name and 
    check temperature,minimum temperature, maximum temperature,humidity and
    pressure.    
       This is the Weather website that I have created using html,javaScript,
    Express,body-parser and  openweathermap server's api key.We require https 
    module to make get request to  openweathermap server.we are going to use 
    listen method and we will give 3000 port number as argument so that our server
    will listen to port 3000. 
        We will use app.get() method and will give "/" as argument to get method so 
    that whenever our server will get a request to home route ,our server will send
    index.html file to user and user will see the input of type text where user can 
    enter any city name and go button to check weather of entered city.
        we will use app.post() method where our server will make https request to 
    openweathermap server using api key and fetch data like temperature, minimum 
    temperature,maximum temperature,humidity and pressure from openweathermap server
    in hexadecimal format.data recieved in hexadecimal format will be parsed using 
    JSON and displayed to user as shown in the video.
